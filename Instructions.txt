Building a web app for tracking movies or web series watched using Java and Spring can be a great way to learn more about web development and Spring framework. Here's an example of how you could go about building such an app:

1.  Define the requirements: Define the key features and functionalities you want to include in the app. For example, you may want users to be able to create accounts, add movies or TV shows to their watchlists, rate and review them, and share their activity with other users.

2.  Design the database: Design the database schema using a tool like MySQL Workbench. You may need tables for users, movies, TV shows, ratings, reviews, and so on.

3.  Set up the development environment: Install Java, Spring, and any other necessary libraries and tools. You can use an integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

4.  Build the models: Create Java classes to represent the database tables, using Spring Data JPA for database access. You may need classes for users, movies, TV shows, ratings, and reviews.

5.  Implement the controllers: Create Spring controllers to handle HTTP requests and map them to the appropriate methods. You may need controllers for creating and updating user accounts, adding movies and TV shows to watchlists, and submitting ratings and reviews.

6.  Build the views: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the user interface. You can use a front-end framework like Bootstrap or Materialize to make the interface more attractive and responsive.

7.  Test the app: Use tools like JUnit and Mockito to test the app's functionality and ensure that it works as expected.

8.  Deploy the app: Deploy the app to a web server or a cloud platform like Heroku.

Here's an example of how you could implement the functionality to add a movie to a user's watchlist:

1.  Create a form that allows users to enter the details of the movie they want to add to their watchlist (e.g., title, director, year of release, genre, etc.).
2.  In the controller, create a method that handles the form submission and saves the movie to the database using Spring Data JPA.
3.  Create a page that displays the user's watchlist, along with the movies they have added.
4.  In the controller, create a method that retrieves the user's watchlist from the database and passes it to the view for display.
5.  In the view, use HTML and JavaScript to display the watchlist and allow users to interact with it (e.g., remove movies from the list, rate movies, etc.).
This is just one example of how you could implement a feature in your app. Be sure to test your code thoroughly and consult online resources like Spring documentation and Stack Overflow if you need help or encounter any problems. Good luck!






s an AI language model, I cannot create a full-fledged web application to demonstrate the steps mentioned above. However, I can provide you with a sample code snippet to give you an idea of how to implement a feature in your application.

Here's an example of how you could implement the functionality to add a movie to a user's watchlist using Spring and Java:

First, you need to create a model class to represent the Movie entity in your application. Here's an example:

less
Copy code
@Entity
@Table(name = "movies")
public class Movie {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String title;

    private String director;

    private Integer year;

    private String genre;

    // getters and setters
}
Next, you need to create a repository interface to handle database operations for the Movie entity. Here's an example:

java
Copy code
@Repository
public interface MovieRepository extends JpaRepository<Movie, Long> {
}
Now you can create a controller to handle HTTP requests for adding a movie to the user's watchlist. Here's an example:

typescript
Copy code
@Controller
public class WatchlistController {

    @Autowired
    private MovieRepository movieRepository;

    @GetMapping("/watchlist")
    public String showWatchlist(Model model) {
        // retrieve the user's watchlist from the database
        List<Movie> watchlist = movieRepository.findAll();
        model.addAttribute("watchlist", watchlist);
        return "watchlist";
    }

    @PostMapping("/watchlist/add")
    public String addMovieToWatchlist(@ModelAttribute("movie") Movie movie) {
        // save the movie to the database
        movieRepository.save(movie);
        return "redirect:/watchlist";
    }
}
Finally, you can create a view to display the user's watchlist and allow them to add movies to it. Here's an example:

php
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Watchlist</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>My Watchlist</h1>

    <ul>
        <th>Movie Title</th>
        <th>Director</th>
        <th>Year</th>
        <th>Genre</th>
    </ul>

    <c:forEach var="movie" items="${watchlist}">
        <li>
            ${movie.title}
            ${movie.director}
            ${movie.year}
            ${movie.genre}
        </li>
    </c:forEach>

    <h2>Add a Movie</h2>

    <form action="/watchlist/add" method="post">
        <label for="title">Title:</label>
        <input type="text" name="title" id="title">
        <br>
        <label for="director">Director:</label>
        <input type="text" name="director" id="director">
        <br>
        <label for="year">Year:</label>
        <input type="number" name="year" id="year">
        <br>
        <label for="genre">Genre:</label>
        <input type="text" name="genre" id="genre">
        <br>
        <input type="submit" value="Add">
    </form>

</body>
</html>
This code will allow users to add movies to their watchlist, which will be saved to the database using Spring Data JPA. You can use this as a starting point to build your own application with more advanced features.

Use IMDb API for metadata for movies
You can use the IMDb API to retrieve metadata for movies in your web application. Here are the steps to do so:

Register for an API key from the IMDb API website.

Add the following dependency to your Spring project's pom.xml file:

php
Copy code
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.googlecode.efficient-java-matrix-library</groupId>
    <artifactId>core</artifactId>
    <version>0.26</version>
</dependency>
Create a service class to handle requests to the IMDb API. Here's an example:
java
Copy code
@Service
public class IMDbService {

    private static final String API_KEY = "your-api-key-here";
    private static final String BASE_URL = "https://imdb-api.com/en/API/";

    public Movie getMovieDetails(String imdbId) {
        String url = BASE_URL + "Title/" + API_KEY + "/" + imdbId;
        RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
        MovieResponse response = restTemplate.getForObject(url, MovieResponse.class);
        return response.toMovie();
    }
}
Create a class to represent the response from the IMDb API. Here's an example:
typescript
Copy code
public class MovieResponse {

    private String id;
    private String title;
    private String year;
    private String plot;
    private String poster;

    // getters and setters

    public Movie toMovie() {
        Movie movie = new Movie();
        movie.setImdbId(this.id);
        movie.setTitle(this.title);
        movie.setYear(Integer.parseInt(this.year));
        movie.setPlot(this.plot);
        movie.setPosterUrl(this.poster);
        return movie;
    }
}
Modify your Movie entity to include the IMDb ID:
less
Copy code
@Entity
@Table(name = "movies")
public class Movie {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String imdbId;

    private String title;

    private String director;

    private Integer year;

    private String genre;

    private String plot;

    private String posterUrl;

    // getters and setters
}
In your controller, call the IMDbService to retrieve movie details using the IMDb ID:
less
Copy code
@Controller
public class MovieController {

    @Autowired
    private IMDbService imdbService;

    @Autowired
    private MovieRepository movieRepository;

    @GetMapping("/movies/{imdbId}")
    public String showMovieDetails(@PathVariable String imdbId, Model model) {
        Movie movie = imdbService.getMovieDetails(imdbId);
        model.addAttribute("movie", movie);
        return "movie-details";
    }

    // other controller methods...
}
With these steps, you can retrieve metadata for movies using the IMDb API and store it in your application's database. This metadata can be used to display information about the movie in your web application.
